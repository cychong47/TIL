# 3. Terminology
	- ARQ : Automatic Repeat Request
	- PLMN : Public Land Mobile Network
	- CQI : Channel Quality Indicator 
	- RSSI : Received Signal Strength Indicator. 
	- CH : Channel
		- ACH : Access CHannel
		- CCH : Control CHannel
		- SCH : Shared CHannel
		- BCH : Broadcast CHannel
	- PD : Physical Downlink
	- PU : Physical Uplink
	- PR : Physical Random
	- RRC : Radio Resource Control 
	- TB : Traffic Block
	- SDU : Service Data Unit = Header + PDU
	- PDU : Payload Data Unit
	- TDCH : Traffic Dedicated CHannel
	- BCCH : Broadcast Control Channel
- {PD, PU} * {SCH, CCH}

# 6. Layer 2
- Layer 2 : SWI/SPL, PDCP, RLC, Mac sublayer
- Mac 
	- Concatenate multiple MAC SDUs belongs to the same logical channel into TB
	- Logical Channel
		- Control CH - CCH 
			- DL BCCH : BCH 
			- Traffic Channel - DTCH 
			- DL DTCH : DL-SCH or UL-SCH
- RLC 
	- Concatenation of upper layer is not supported
	- PDU sequence number is independent to upper layer seqeunce number
	- 1 RLC SDU is 1 MAC PDU or segemented to several MAC PDUs
- PDCP
	- 3 byte header including 18bis sequence number
- SWI/SPL
	- Switching, Split 
	- (UE) End marker in UL 

#  7. RRC
	- MIB(Master Information Block)
	- SIB(System Information Block) is not broadcasted in 5G 

# 9.  ARQ vs. HARQ
	- ARQ in Layer 2 while HARQ in Layer 1
	- HARQ Asynchronous adapted
		- Uplink ACK/NAK are sent on xPUCCH or xPUSCH - configured by RRC
	- ARQ
		- retransmit 5G RLC PDU or PDU segment based on RLC status report
		- Polling 
		- receiver can trigger RLC status report - P bit가 없어도 status report를 보낸다는 의미인 듯.
